general notes:
n can include irony
logistics includes availability, approvals, govt planning, supply chain issues, local availability, opinions on how vaccines should be distributed. anything affecting how vaccines will flow and be available. It doesn't include updates on vaccination count. also includes spillage/waste/inefficiencies
General include updates on rates, case counts, vaccination counts
Rejected means not related to human vaccination

look into now:
replace side effects with safety
may need to review side effects and add more negative labels
could be some l=False where there is vaccine policy discussed that should make it True
n = true and rest = false. this should be "general negativity that isn't described by any other category"

look into later: 
g,h includes pleads for vaccination that could be studied on its own
g,h includes should i get vaccinated which is another intersting category esp if you look at comments

finished:
looking at logistics or mandates = True and fixed up their negative labels. l/m=False hasn't been looked at tho.
